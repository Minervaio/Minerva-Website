        <h1>Our Consulting Practices</h1>

        <p>“Virtual CTO” Beyond coding, our expertise can help you better manage the development process. We strongly believe that software development should not be putting out fires. Our team uses agile software development practices to create a delivery-focused process that empowers the developers. By setting clear priorities and deliverables in smaller chunks, it becomes easier to track projects and deal with the bumps along the road.</p>

        <h1>Our UI Practices</h1>

        <p>Minerva works with the best designers and front-end engineers in order to create brilliant user experiences. Truly beautiful design lives at the intersection of beauty and functionality. This is why our engineers and designers work together so closely.</p>

        <h1>Our Software Development Practices</h1>

        <p>As technology becomes a larger part of our lives, the applications we create are becoming more complex to meet the demand. However, by utilizing a modular architecture and modern frameworks these large applications become manageable.</p>

        <p>A service-oriented architecture allows for the separation of the data and presentation layer. Creating a normalized API allows you to publish once and consume everywhere. No longer will your iOS application and your web application need separate interfaces. This allows you to separately scale your infrastructure intelligently.</p>

        <p>This is done by utilizing a combination of technologies based on your project’s needs. A single application may use python for the API layer, Node.js for the middle tier, and iOS for the presentation layer. This flexibility allows you to take advantage of the strengths of each of these technologies, without having to suffer their weaknesses throughout your entire stack.</p>
